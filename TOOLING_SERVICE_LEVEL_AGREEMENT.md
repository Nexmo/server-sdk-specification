## Service Availability

Support for "Dedicated Support" will be available under Vonage's normal support structure, including access to our support staff.

Other levels will have availability as documented by their service level (for example, "Priority Support" repositories should receive a response within three business days). Note that the response does not indicate closure of the request or full completion of any request, just that our team will respond and begin any resolution process within that timeframe.

Unless otherwise designated, software will still be considered "Open Source" and are provided without warranty or expectation of service.

## End User Requirements

End User responsibilities and requirements include:

- Submitting as much detail as possible to Support or GitHub issues
- Understanding minimum requirements for all software
- Checking all relevant documentation before requesting assistance
- Understanding of all applicable Open Source Licenses associated with the code.

## Vonage DevRex Requirements

No additional services will be guaranteed outside of the scope defined in this document. While Vonage's DevRex team will make their best attempts at resolving customer issues, we cannot support all the different installation environments our software may be used under. All work toward a resolution is considered "best effort," and there may be times where a resolution is not possible. During those times, the End User is encouraged to fork the relevant Open Source software and implement their own resolutions.
